# Ideal Function Assignment Project

## Overview
This project loads training, ideal, and test datasets, matches training functions to ideal functions using least squares, assigns test points, stores results in a SQLite database (via SQLAlchemy), and visualizes results with Matplotlib and Bokeh.

## Data Privacy & Submission
**Note:**  
As required by the assignment guidelines, the actual data files (`train.csv`, `ideal.csv`, `test.csv`) are **not included** in this submission.  
To run the code, you will need to request access to the datasets.

## Features
- Object-oriented design with inheritance
- Custom exception handling
- SQLAlchemy database integration
- Interactive Bokeh and static Matplotlib visualizations
- Unit tests for all major modules

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python src/main.py
```
- Interactive Bokeh visualizations will open in your browser as `ideal_function_bokeh_visualizations.html`.

## Testing
```bash
pytest
```

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Source code modules
